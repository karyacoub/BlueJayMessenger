# Purpl.
A simple P2P instant messaging client.

# v0.11:
As promised, I will be documenting my progress more thoroughly from now on. Here we go.

 - Unfortunately I've had a ton of coursework this semester, so I've only been able to work on *Purpl.* very sporadically.
 - I've been thinking about how I'll be implementing a GUI with the code I've already written. At this point, Purpl. is inherantly a console application, so i may need to rewrite some code to make it less console-dependat. 
 - I know that GUI implementation in C# is pretty straightforward (especailly with Visual Studio), so I'm going to be using that as a starting point.
 - I'm thinking I can probably build a .dll file (or maybe a .lib file) from my code, and import that file into a C# program containing the GUI. We'll see how that works out.
