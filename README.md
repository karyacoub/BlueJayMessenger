# Purpl.
A simple P2P instant messaging client.

# v0.1:
 - C++ socket code that allows multiple clients to connect to a single server, and exchange messages.
 - Terminal application, no GUI.
 - There is a Linux version and a Windows version, mostly becuase I started this project on Linux, but later migrated to windows. I didn't want to delete the Linux code in case I ever wanted to refer to it in the future (which I did, the only difference between the Windows code and the Linux code is that Windows doesn't have the same system calls that Linus has for sockets.
 - I'll keep the Linux version here, since I don't see a reason to get rid of it, but I probably won't be porting future versions of the application to Linux. I'm going to be focussing on developing it for Windows for the time being.
 - I'll be trying to document my progress on here in more detail for future versions.
