# Purpl.
A simple instant messaging client.

# v0.11:
 - The project is no longer a C++ terminal application, but a web-based application.
 - Decided to use Javascript with the Electron framework to create a desktop web-based application.
 - The chat server backend is created in Java using websockets from the Grizzly framework. 
 - 'ws', a Node.js websocket library, is used on the client-side to connect to and communicate with the chat server.
